# 🗄️ GlusterVault – A Network Distributed Storage System 🚀

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**GlusterVault** is a network-based distributed storage system designed to provide **fault tolerance, data replication, and high availability** across multiple nodes.  
The system leverages **GlusterFS** to ensure consistent and reliable data storage even in the event of node failures.

This project demonstrates core concepts of **distributed systems**, **storage replication**, and **fault-tolerant architecture**.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ Distributed and replicated storage across multiple nodes  
- ✅ Fault tolerance to handle node failures  
- ✅ Data consistency and synchronization among nodes  
- ✅ High availability of stored files  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **GlusterFS** – Distributed file system  
- **Ubuntu / Linux** – Operating system for nodes  
- **Python / Bash** – Automation and management scripts  

---

## 🧩 System Architecture
The system is built using multiple virtual machines configured as:
- Storage nodes (servers)
- Client node for accessing the distributed volume

Data is replicated across nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
